  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Familiarization with Excitation and Emission Spectra, Mirror Image Relation and Stokes Shift" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift/Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift_01_Usability_smk.org][Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Slider bar".

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. The user should be able to select the solution of his choice
     using the slider with ease. 
  3. Once the Volumetric flask is selected, the slider bar should
     become hidden. 
  4. The user should be able to use the slider bar again when he/she wants
     to reset the experiment.
