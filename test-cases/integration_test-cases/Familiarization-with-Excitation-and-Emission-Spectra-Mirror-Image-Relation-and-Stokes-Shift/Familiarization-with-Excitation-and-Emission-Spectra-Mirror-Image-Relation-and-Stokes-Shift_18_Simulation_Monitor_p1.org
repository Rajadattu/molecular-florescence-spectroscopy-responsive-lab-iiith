* Environment

  +  OS: Windows 7, Linux
  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Familiarization with Excitation and Emission Spectra, Mirror Image Relation and Stokes Shift" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift/Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift_01_Usability_smk.org][Familiarization-with-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-Mirror-Image-Relation-and-Stokes-Shift_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Monitor"

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. The monitor should not be able to operate until the  solution is processed in the spectrofluorimeter.
  3. On click monitor,  A new tab should be opened with the output graph.
