  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Demonstration of pH Effect on Fluorescence Excitation and Emission Spectra of a Fluorophore" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore/Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org][Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Flask" contained the solution.

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. When the user clicks on the flask, the flask should be moved from
     shelf to the experiment desk.
  3. 3. The Spectofluorimeter should not be opened and run until the
     functionality of the flask is finished.
