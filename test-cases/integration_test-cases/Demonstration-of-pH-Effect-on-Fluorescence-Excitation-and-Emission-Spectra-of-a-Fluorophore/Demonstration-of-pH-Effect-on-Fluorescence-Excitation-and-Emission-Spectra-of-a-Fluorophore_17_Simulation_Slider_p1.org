  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

 +  To view the Objective of "Demonstration of pH Effect on Fluorescence Excitation and Emission Spectra of a Fluorophore" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore/Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org][Demonstration-of-pH-Effect-on-Fluorescence-Excitation-and-Emission-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Slider bar".

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. The user should be able to select the solution of his choice
     using the slider with ease. 
  3. A warning message should be appear when the user try to select
     the flask with out choosing the solution first.
  3. Once the Volumetric flask is selected, the slider bar should
     be hidden. 
  4. The user should be able to use the slider bar again when he/she try
     to reset the experiment.
