* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of  "Relationship between the Concentration of a Fluorophore and its Fluorescence Intensity: Determination of Unknown Concentration of an Analyte" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Relationship-between-the-Concentration-of-a-Fluorophore-and-its-Fluorescence-Intensity-Determination-of-Unknown-Concentration-of-an-Analyte/Relationship-between-the-Concentration-of-a-Fluorophore-and-its-Fluorescence-Intensity-Determination-of-Unknown-Concentration-of-an-Analyte_01_Usability_smk.org][Relationship-between-the-Concentration-of-a-Fluorophore-and-its-Fluorescence-Intensity-Determination-of-Unknown-Concentration-of-an-Analyte_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Simulation" link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters

* Review/comments
