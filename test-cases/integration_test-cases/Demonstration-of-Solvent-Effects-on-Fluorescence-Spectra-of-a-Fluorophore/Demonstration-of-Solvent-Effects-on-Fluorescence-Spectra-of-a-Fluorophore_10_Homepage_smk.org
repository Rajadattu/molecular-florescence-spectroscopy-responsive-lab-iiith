* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Demonstration-of-Solvent-Effects-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore/Demonstration-of-Solvent-Effects-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org][Demonstration-of-Solvent-Effects-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil
     
* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Demonstration of Solvent Effects on Fluorescence Spectra of a Fluorophore" link.
  +  Check if there are any distortions, spelling mistakes and junk
     characters in the Simulation page.

* Expected result
