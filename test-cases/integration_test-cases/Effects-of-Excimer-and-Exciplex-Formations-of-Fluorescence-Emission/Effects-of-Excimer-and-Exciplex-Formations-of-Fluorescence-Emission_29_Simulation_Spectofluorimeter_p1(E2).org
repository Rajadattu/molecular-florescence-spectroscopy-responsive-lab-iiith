  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Simulation of "'Exciplex Formation lab' inEffects of Excimer and Exciplex Formations on Fluorescence Emission"     experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission/Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission_01_Usability_smk.org][Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "spectrophotometer"
  +  Check the functionality of the buttons, lid and lights of the spectrofluorimeter.

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. The spectrophotometer should only be operated on click of "Start
