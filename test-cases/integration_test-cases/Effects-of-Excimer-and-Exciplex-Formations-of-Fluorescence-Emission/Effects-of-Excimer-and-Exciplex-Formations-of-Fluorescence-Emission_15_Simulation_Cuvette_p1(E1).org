* Environment

  +  OS: Windows 7, Linux
  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Simulation of "'Excimer Formation lab' in Effects of Excimer and Exciplex Formations on Fluorescence Emission" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission/Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission_01_Usability_smk.org][Effects-of-Excimer-and-Exciplex-Formations-of-Fluorescence-Emission_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Cuvette"
  +  Check the placing of the cuvette into the spectofluorimeter.

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. When the user clicks on the cuvette, the cuvette should move from
     shelf to the experiment desk with out any distortions.
  3. On click the cuvette should be inserted in the spectofluorimeter
     with out any distortions.
  4. A reference covette should be placed in the meter along with the
     cuvette which contains the solution prepared by the user.
  5. Placing of the cuvette in the Spectofluorimeter should be
     perfect.
