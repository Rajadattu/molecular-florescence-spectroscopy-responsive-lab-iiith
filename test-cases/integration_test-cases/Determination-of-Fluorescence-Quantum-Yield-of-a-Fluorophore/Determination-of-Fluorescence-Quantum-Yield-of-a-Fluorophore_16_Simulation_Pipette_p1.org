* Environment

  +  OS: Windows 7, Linux
  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Determination of Fluorescence Quantum Yield of a Fluorophore" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Determination-of-Fluorescence-Quantum-Yield-of-a-Fluorophore/Determination-of-Fluorescence-Quantum-Yield-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org][Determination-of-Fluorescence-Quantum-Yield-of-a-Fluorophore_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Pippete"

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. Once the cuvette is placed on the experiment desk click on the Pippete, the pippte should be moved from
     shelf to the Volumetric flask which is placed on the experiment desk.
  3. On click, the pippete should collect the solution from the flask.
  4. On click, the pippete should come out of the flask.
  5. On click, the pippete should pour the solution in to the cuvette
     and should return back to the shelf.
  6. Functionality of the pippete should have ease with out any
     distortions.
