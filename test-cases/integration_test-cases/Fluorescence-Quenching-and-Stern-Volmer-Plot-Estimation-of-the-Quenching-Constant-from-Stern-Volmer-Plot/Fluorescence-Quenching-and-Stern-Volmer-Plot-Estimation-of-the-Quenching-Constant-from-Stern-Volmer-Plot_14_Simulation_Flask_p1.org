  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Fluorescence Quenching and Stern-Volmer Plot: Estimation of the Quenching Constant from Stern-Volmer Plot" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Fluorescence-Quenching-and-Stern-Volmer-Plot-Estimation-of-the-Quenching-Constant-from-Stern-Volmer-Plot/Fluorescence-Quenching-and-Stern-Volmer-Plot-Estimation-of-the-Quenching-Constant-from-Stern-Volmer-Plot_01_Usability_smk.org][Fluorescence-Quenching-and-Stern-Volmer-Plot-Estimation-of-the-Quenching-Constant-from-Stern-Volmer-Plot_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here to go to lab" link
  +  Check the functionality of the "Volumetric Flask"

* Expected result

  1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
  2. When the user clicks on the flask, the flask should move from
     shelf to the experiment desk with out any distortions.
  3. The Spectofluorimeter should not be opened run until the
     functionality of the flask is finished.
