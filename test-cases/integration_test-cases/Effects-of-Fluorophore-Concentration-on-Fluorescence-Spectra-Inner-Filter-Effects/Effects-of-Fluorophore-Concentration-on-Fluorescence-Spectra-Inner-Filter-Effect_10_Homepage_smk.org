* Objective

   + To be able to simulate the "Effects of Fluorophore Concentration on Fluorescence Spectra: Inner Filter Effects" experiment
     
* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effects/Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effect_01_Usability_smk.org][Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effect_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil
     
* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Effects of Fluorophore Concentration on Fluorescence Spectra: Inner Filter Effects" link.
  +  Check if there are any distortions, spelling mistakes and junk
     characters in the Simulation page.

* Expected result
