* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/molecular-florescence-spectroscopy-responsive-lab-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effects/Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effect_01_Usability_smk.org][Effects-of-Fluorophore-Concentration-on-Fluorescence-Spectra-Inner-Filter-Effect_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Simulation" link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters

* Review/comments
